# WebScraping
Bash script that scrapes NHL.COM and retrieves the latest lineup.  Parses the file for the current day's schedule or the current lineup for any team.

## nhl_lineup.html
This file is used only for testing. It is a curl from the actual NHL.COM so that we can always something to work with incase they don't update the url, like during the 2026 Olympic break.

## Disclaimer
I'm far from any kind of programmer. Although I've been sitting infront of computer montor for the last 45+ years dabbling in all sorts of programming languages, a programmer does not make!  I wote this script for two reasons:
1. Get better at bash
2. I like hockey
